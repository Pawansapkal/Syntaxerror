ParkSense
Smart Parking Prediction for Smarter Cities

https://pawansapkal.github.io/Syntaxerror/

Welcome to ParkSense! This is our project for the hackathon. It is a smart dashboard that helps people and city authorities understand parking availability in real-time.

The Problem
Finding parking in a busy city like Melbourne is stressful. It wastes time, causes traffic jams, and burns unnecessary fuel. We wanted to solve the question: "Where can I park right now without circling the block for 20 minutes?"

The Solution
ParkSense is an intelligent platform that predicts which parking zones are full and which are empty. It doesn't just show current data; it analyzes patterns to give a "Parking Stress Index" (PSI).

We built a lightweight dashboard that visualizes:
* Real-time parking availability.
* Future predictions .
* Live events that might affect traffic.

Key Features
* Interactive Map: We used Leaflet.js to show parking zones. Green markers mean "Good," and Red means "Busy."
* Parking Stress Index (PSI): A simple score (0-100) to show how hard it is to park in the city right now.
* Authority Insight Mode: A toggle for city planners to see why parking is busy (e.g., Peak office hours, Events).
* Event Simulation: Click the "Simulate Event" button to see what happens to the city when a big game starts at the MCG (Melbourne Cricket Ground)! ⚡

Tech Stack
We kept the tech stack simple and effective for rapid prototyping:
* Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Custom styling)
* Logic: Vanilla JavaScript
* Maps: Leaflet.js & OpenStreetMap
* Icons: Lucide Icons




How to Run This Project
Since this is a lightweight web prototype, it is very easy to run:

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in any web browser (Chrome, Edge, etc.).
3.  That's it! The dashboard will load instantly.

Future Scope : 
In the future, we plan to:
* Connect real IoT sensor data from parking lots.
* Add a mobile app version for drivers.
* Include pricing integration to show the cheapest parking spots.
